# Welcome to Rig Mechanist

**Rig Mechanist** is a unified Blender addon suite designed to bring CAD-like precision and structural rigor to the rigging and modeling workflow.

It consists of three specialized tools that work in harmony:

1.  **EmptyProxyRig (v2)**: *The Skeleton* - Structural integrity and origin management.
2.  **VisualSnapAssist (v4)**: *The Precision* - Geometric snapping and rotation.
3.  **BoneIK_Tools**: *The Motion* - Instant IK setup.

## Concept

Blender is excellent for organic and intuitive modeling, but often lacks the "engineering" feel required for mechanical rigging or hard-surface modeling. **Rig Mechanist** fills this gap by introducing:

*   **Geometric Snapping**: Snap to virtual centers of circles, tangent points, and intersections.
*   **Proxy Rigging**: Design your rig with Empties first, ensuring perfect pivots before committing to Bones.
*   **Visual Feedback**: See exactly where your pivots and constraints are with GPU-accelerated overlays.
